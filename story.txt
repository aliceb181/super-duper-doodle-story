Cornelius Cheddar was a British cheese farmer turned cheese tycoon. After opening his
96th cheese factory, Cornelius was finally able to take a break from work and
enjoy his hobbies. He was especially interested in water research and now he was able to
dedicate his time to this. One afternoon, as he was documenting the water level in the 
local puddle, he heard a noise coming from 35 km away from the Saint-Corneille forest. 
He gathered his equipment, which consisted of measuring tape and a sharpie, and decided 
to walk over into the forest and investigate the noise. As he stepped foot into the forest 
he was taken aback by the... 

Cody: 

smell. It smelled like burning flesh which frightened him. He saw a glowing tree that looked
rather ominous. He decided to document and study this interesting tree for research purposes.
As he neared the tree, out of his peripheral vision he saw the forest start to close in on him.
When he looked back he saw an army amount of people dressed in black cloaks slowly closing in on him...

Ella:
This was an army of witches and warlocks. They had come to investigate what he was. He continued to
look at the tree not realizing that with every second they were getting closer and closer. He was
surrounded on all ends. After finally snapping out of the gaze he was stuck in, he became terrified.
They all began chanting...

Israel:
"SEIZE HIM...SEIZE HIM...". There was no for him to run. He looked around, clearly in a panic. Right
before they were about to grab him, he remembered he still had a bit of cheddar cheese in his pocket.
He turned and threw it far away, creating a distraction, allowing him to escape. He never again would
venture into that forest.

Cornelius headed home, having learned two very important lessons: Don't investigate strange noises in 
the forest and always keep your cheddar close.

The End.
